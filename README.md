Hello I am Beastie.
Here is a little tutorial:
1. To create new project use '/create_project' command
2. To create any file in your project use '/create_file' command in terminal channel
3. To change file content in your file send or edit message in the following channel (**DONT DELETE DEFAULT JS CODE IN HTML FILE PRESET**)
4. To check out your html output use '/display_project command (using this command write in file name in your project **with extension**)
